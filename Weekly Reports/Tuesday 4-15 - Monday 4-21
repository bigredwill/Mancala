Team leader of the week: Will Simons
Team members: Will Simons, Michael Daniels, Avi Dey

Summary 

This week we continued the planning for our Mancala game. We have been busy with school and life, so not much time has been put into our creation. We have a good design for the program, so development should go smoothly. When we met, we used white boards for collaborating on our ideas. They helped greatly in the creation and evolution of our program design. Our plan for the coming weeks is to implement our design and continue refining our game.  We are currently on track for finishing the game on time, albeit slowly. But slow and steady wins the race, or so they say.
